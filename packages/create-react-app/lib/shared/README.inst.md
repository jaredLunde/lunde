### Routes and pages
This app uses [`react-router`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) for routing. 
Routes are configured in [src/pages/index.js](tree/master/src/pages/index.js)

### Styles and theming

to add CSS styles to components. The theme is configured in [src/theme/index.js](tree/master/src/theme/index.js)

### Code splitting
This app uses [`react-broker`](https://github.com/jaredLunde/react-broker) for code splitting routes.

### Static assets
This app uses [`file-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-loader) and [`responsive-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/responsive-loader) 
to include images, fonts, and other files in your bundle assets. When you import a file from your
[`src/assets`](tree/master/src/pages/index.js) directory it will be loaded with `file-loader` when the
extension doesn't match `(jpe?g|png|webm)` and `responsive-loader` when it does.
