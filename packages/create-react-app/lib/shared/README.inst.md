## üå≥ Things to know
And places to go

### Routes and pages
This app uses [`react-router-dom`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) for routing. 
Routes are configurable in [src/pages/index.js](tree/master/src/pages/index.js)

### Styles and theming
CSS styles are added to components with [`curls`](https://github.com/jaredLunde/curls) and [`style-hooks`](https://style-hooks.jaredlunde.com). 
Its theme is configurable in [src/theme/index.js](tree/master/src/theme/index.js)

### Code splitting
Routes are code split by [`react-broker`](https://github.com/jaredLunde/react-broker) which
is a great tool that also provides component preloading and SSR capability.

### Static assets
This app uses [`file-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-loader) and [`responsive-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/responsive-loader) 
to include images, fonts, and other files in your bundle assets. When you import a file from your
[`src/assets`](tree/master/src/pages/index.js) directory it will be loaded with `file-loader` when the
extension doesn't match `(jpe?g|png|webm)` and `responsive-loader` when it does.

### Entry files
| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [src/client.js](tree/master/src/client.js) | The entry file for building the app with a `web` target |
| [src/server.js](tree/master/src/server.js) | The entry file for building the app with a `node` target |


### Configuration files
